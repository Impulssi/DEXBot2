/**
 * market_adapter/utils/file_json_cache.ts — write-through JSON read cache
 *
 * The hourly cycle re-read every bot's candle file (6 x ~250 KiB) before writing
 * it straight back, which cost ~1.4 ms of JSON.parse per file per cycle for data
 * this process had just serialized itself. Nothing else normally writes those
 * files, but "normally" is not "never" (a gap-repair run, ama_signal_runner or
 * the clear script can), so the cache never trusts process-local state blindly:
 *
 *   - Entries exist only for files THIS process wrote (`noteJsonWritten`), so
 *     the cached value is known to be what was just serialized to disk.
 *   - A cached entry is served only while the file's mtime still matches the
 *     stamp taken right after that write, and its size still matches wherever
 *     the storage adapter reports one. Any other writer invalidates it. (The
 *     browser storage adapter's stat() has no size, so in a browser bundle this
 *     degrades to mtime-only; the cache is only wired into the Node runtime.)
 *   - A served entry is consumed (deleted). A cycle that reads the file, mutates
 *     the object and then fails before writing therefore cannot poison the next
 *     cycle: the entry is already gone, and the next read re-parses.
 *   - When the file cannot be stat'ed (missing, no storage adapter, or a test
 *     injecting its own loader) nothing is cached and the loader always runs.
 *
 * Net effect for the hourly loop: the parse this process would have paid to read
 * back its own previous output disappears, with no path to stale data.

 * CONTRACT: `value` is held by reference and there is no copy. The caller must
 * not mutate it afterwards (and must not hand the same object to anything else
 * that will), otherwise the cache would serve something that no longer matches
 * the file. The current call site serializes `value` and then never touches it
 * again, so it satisfies this.
 *
 * KNOWN RACE (accepted): the stamp is taken after the write, so another writer
 * landing between our write and our stat() would make this entry carry its
 * stamp with our value, and a later read could serve that stale payload. The
 * window is sub-millisecond and the adapter is the only writer of these files
 * in-process, so this is not worth a hash of a 250 KiB payload; a genuine
 * cross-process writer is far better served by the mtime check failing on its
 * own write than by a cache that guesses.
