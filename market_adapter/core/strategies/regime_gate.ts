/**
 * Cross-cycle memoization for the regime gate.
 *
 * The adapter runs one cycle per hour per bot, but only ONE new candle closes in
 * that window, and the Hurst/PE state at bar i depends solely on the previous
 * `window` prices. Re-creating both analyzers and re-feeding all ~780 closes
 * every hour therefore recomputed ~99.8% of the same numbers — the single
 * largest CPU item in a cycle.
 *
 * When the caller supplies a stable `cacheKey` (the adapter passes
 * `<botKey>:<intervalSeconds>`), the analyzers and the already-computed
 * per-bar series are kept per key. The next cycle resumes the memoized state
 * when the regime parameters are unchanged and the incoming window is the
 * cached one advanced: same bars, with k leading bars dropped and m new bars
 * appended. A gap repair, a corrected bar, a rewritten value, a different
 * market or a config change all fail that check and fall back to a full
 * recomputation. The resumed result is bit-identical to a from-scratch run in
 * the headline multiplier and in every bar from that run's first ready bar
 * onwards; the pre-warmup prefix can differ by the one-bar readiness offset
 * described below. See tests/test_market_adapter_entropy_equivalence.ts.
 *
 * The leading-drop tolerance is what makes this worthwhile in production: the
 * adapter caps the analysis window (rawKeepCount + analysisKeepCount), so once
 * history saturates every hourly cycle SLIDES the window by one bar. A
 * strict "cached is a prefix of incoming" test misses every one of those
 * cycles. It is safe because both analyzers are rolling: their state depends
 * only on the last `bufferSize` bars, so as long as the shared region still
 * covers that much history, feeding only the new bars lands on exactly the
 * state a cold replay of the whole window would produce.
 *
 * What a resume does NOT reproduce: the warmup boundary in the historical
 * prefix. A warm analyzer pair has been fed one more bar in total than a freshly
 * created one, so it reports its first value one bar earlier. Only the prefix
 * is affected — the headline multiplier and every bar from the cold run's first
 * ready index onwards are identical, which is every bar the service can act on
 * (regimeMultipliers scales a per-bar offset that is itself zero before the
 * AMA/Kalman channels are ready). See
 * tests/test_market_adapter_entropy_equivalence.ts.
 *
 * Without a `cacheKey` the function is stateless, exactly as before.

 * requirement guarantees the resumed stream's last `bufferBars` values are the
 * same values the incoming stream ends with — the analyzers are rolling, so
