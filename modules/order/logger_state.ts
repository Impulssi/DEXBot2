/**
 * modules/order/logger_state.ts - Logger State Manager
 *
 * State tracking engine for change detection and audit logging.
 * Exports a single LoggerState class that enables smart logging by detecting state changes.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Track previous state across multiple categories (funds, orders, fills, boundary, errors)
 * - Detect and report what changed between state transitions
 * - Determine if logging is needed (only log when values change)
 * - Maintain audit history of state changes
 * - Calculate significance of numeric changes against thresholds
 *
 * Used by Logger to:
 * - Skip redundant logging when nothing changed
 * - Only output on significant state transitions
 * - Maintain audit trail for debugging
 *
 * ===============================================================================
 * TABLE OF CONTENTS - LoggerState Class (3 methods)
 * ===============================================================================
 *
 * INITIALIZATION (1 method)
 *   1. constructor() - Create new LoggerState with empty previousState
 *      Initializes tracking for: funds, orders, fills, boundary, errors
 *
 * CHANGE DETECTION (1 method)
 *   2. detectChanges(category, current) - Detect changes between previous and current state
 *      Returns { isNew: boolean, changes: Object } with detailed change information
 *
 * INTERNAL UTILITIES (1 method)
 *   3. _deepDiff(prev, current) - Deep diff between two objects
 *      Recursively compares objects, detects all changes and deletions
 *      Returns Object with format: { key: { from: oldVal, to: newVal } }
 *
 * ===============================================================================
 *
 * STATE CATEGORIES:
 * - funds: Available, committed, total, cache, and fee tracking
 * - orders: Order counts, states, and type distributions
 * - fills: Fill operations and trade history
 * - boundary: Grid boundary positions and movements
 * - errors: Error conditions and recovery attempts
 *
 * CHANGE DETECTION ALGORITHM:
 * 1. First call: Returns { isNew: true, changes: current } and stores state
 * 2. Subsequent calls: Compares with stored state using _deepDiff
 * 3. _deepDiff: Recursively compares all keys, detects additions/deletions
 * 4. Returns: { isNew: false, changes: { key: { from, to } } }
 *
